<h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>Project has been created based on a provided blueprint from Figma but the whole logic, website feeling and mobile design was up to me. I was doing this project in a recruitment process for some company and later I've decided to make some improvements and add new features. Project is made with Tailwind and vanilla JavaScript as it was the guideline from the company.

<h3>DEVELOPMENT GUIDE</h3>
<p>To run and build Tailwind, please type in CLI:</p>
```
npm install
npm run start
```
Then you can view this project simply by live server extension.
