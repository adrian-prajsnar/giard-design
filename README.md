# GiardDesign - Landing Page

[giarddesign-ap11.netlify.app](https://giarddesign-ap11.netlify.app/)

## Description

GiardDesign is a dynamic landing page project created based on a provided blueprint from Figma. While the initial design concept was provided, I took charge of independently developing the website's logic, user experience, and mobile design. This project originated during a recruitment process for a certain company, and later, I proactively enhanced it by incorporating additional features and improvements. <br>
GiardDesign is built using **Tailwind CSS & vanilla JavaScript**, in alignment with the company's guidelines.

GiardDesign comes with several great **features**:

- Search Navigation: Easily find what you need.
- Dropdown: Quick information and access to a specific section.
- Mobile Navigation: Smooth, elegant, and accessible.
- Interactive Slider: Engaging content presentation.
- Popup Gallery: Stunning image displays.
- Transitions and Animations: Modern and smooth visual effects.
- Modern and Responsive Design: Looks great on all devices.
